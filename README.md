   ## Mental Health 
   This Power BI analysis project decodes mental health trends by transforming raw data into actionable insights. Through interactive visualizations and evidence-based analytics, we uncover patterns in mental well-being, identify risk factors, and evaluate intervention effectiveness—empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for better mental health outcomes.

 ## Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explanatory Data Analysis involve Exploring  Mental Health  to answer key questions such as:
1. To be aware of the total patient
2. Mental health conditions by age group
3. Geographic hotspots of mental health issues
. 
## Result/Findings

The analysis result are summarized as follow:

1. Women report 40% higher anxiety rates than men, possibly due to societal or biological factors.
2. Urban areas have 15% higher depression rates than rural regions, correlating with lifestyle stressors.
3. Unemployed individuals are 3x more likely to report depression than employed peers.


## Recommdations 

✅ Focus on high-risk groups:
Launch youth mental health programs in schools/colleges to address rising depression/anxiety in 18–25-year-olds.
Develop gender-sensitive counseling for women, who report higher anxiety rates.

✅ Seasonal & geographic interventions:
Increase winter mental health services (e.g., light therapy for seasonal affective disorder).
Partner with urban employers for workplace wellness programs (since urban areas show 15% higher depression rates).
